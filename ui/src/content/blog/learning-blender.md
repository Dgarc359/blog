  Learning blender after years of failure
---

If you're anything like me, then you've probably tried to learn blender a time
or two. The usual experience generally boils down to:

- Download blender after having uninstalled it years ago
- Open up the program
- Delete the starter cube (That's the one thing you're an expert at)
- Stare blankly at the screen
- Look up a tutorial to figure out how to do that thing that made you download blender in the first place
- Fail to successfully use the blender interface (Each UI element has some esoteric purpose outside of your understanding)
- Uninstall blender

I've been doing a little bit of game development, and I had that slight dread in
the back of my mind about using blender again. There's small moments of impostor
syndrome hitting in waves when I open the program.

But this time, it's different. For some reason, all the little things you've heard
after years of trying start bubbling up to the surface and things start clicking into place
slowly (read: hours and hours of suffering / failure transform into knowledge!)

My personal 'Aha!' moment was trying to just work from a start cube and extruding out what
I needed in order to construct whatever the 3D object was. In this way, I was
in a sense, doing some additive sculpting.

I've had previous experience with things like illustrator, so node-based editing
is something I'm decently familiar with. I was able to continue extruding as a
base workflow to get some initial models created.


TODO: insert 3d models?
