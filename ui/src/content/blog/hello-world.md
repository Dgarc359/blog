  Introductory blog post
---
I am a Software Engineer, Graphic Designer, Video Game Developer, and Musician! I guess with this blog I'm also now a writer
(when do I get my pay raise?).

I've spent a long time around technology. Back in middle school I spent
a whole weekend trying to figure out how to install gentoo, because
I was told it was what the cool kids used. I never pursued linux for
its intended purpose until way later, but that's just one example of
how I like to challenge myself with technology that I find new and interesting.

There's a problem though.

None of this stuff happened. Well, it did happen, but where's the proof?
Where's the evidence of all of the hours I've spent setting up different linux distributions, just for fun?
All the different PC builds I've made, and their specifications?
The machine learning?
What was I thinking at the time?

It's too late to get answers to a lot of the questions I would have, or that someone else might have.
I could spend time thinking about it, writing about it, reminiscing, 
and trying my hardest to remember every single little detail.

However, I think the more interesting stuff is forward. It's the stuff I'm gonna write about in this blog (hopefully).
This'll be the spot to find any future updates, until the situation changes.
