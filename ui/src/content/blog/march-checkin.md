  Where exactly have I been??

# What a crazy year so far!
2024 has been pretty insane. There's been so many technological developments
up to now that I can't even cover them all. Some highlights are:
* Google deepmind creates a [generalist AI agent](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/) for 3d virtual environments
* Spacex crew 7 [successfully splashes back down to earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJAUetG6C2E)
* Nvidia creates an insanely powered [ai chip](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing)
* Redis [no longer open source!?](https://redis.com/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/)

And that's just the tech news. I've been spending a lot of time _'in the shop'_
creating various little knicknacks and doo-dads! Here's a recap of what I've been
getting myself into:
* Started studying maths again!
* Started [streaming](https://twitch.tv/ss_dvd) my coding adventures!
* Created [my first assembly program](https://github.com/Dgarc359/hyperbolic-time-chamber/blob/dev/bare-metal-fight/src/fight.s)
* Worked on a facelift for my [trading card game](https://mtg.nameofthemist.com)
* Began hosting my own personal git provider (Going with forgejo for now!)
* Started tinkering with oculus quest pro game dev with godot

For anybody reading this in South Florida, I'm going to be attending SoFlo Dev Con 2024!
Come say hi and let's hang out there!

Phew! That's a lot, and I wouldn't say that's all inclusive. I've been doing some
maintenance on my local linux computer that's acting as a game console. Hope to write
a blog on that one day!

I'm most excited to be on my math journey. I think I've made a decision on what I
want to study in the future, and improving my math skills is a pre-requisite to that.
Soon, I shall be moving into studying Physics and Calculus. We'll see what happens with that!

Speaking of literature, I'm also reading a book outlining the construction of an
operating system. For those of you wizened and grizzled veterans, you may know of it,
it goes under the name 'minix' and the goal is to create my own implementation of the
operating system! This is going to be a _huge_ project, but I'm hoping to learn a ton
about Rust in the process! I've already started implementing a few things at work in Rust,
and I want to continue pushing my skills in that language.


# Let's get less technical
Technology is so pervasive, isn't it? When I'm not programming I'll sometimes read a book
or play some music. Recently, I finished a book that I thought was most excellent.
If you're a fan of Science Fiction, and novels like 'Dune' or 'Enders Game', then I
think that you will really like this one!

> _Fire Upon the Deepness - Vernor Vinge_

I'll admit this book has some deep technical aspects to it. But I'll defer to one
of the author reviews which calls this book _'mindbending'_... yeah, I'll go ahead
and give that statement a +1!

Vernor Vinge passed away just 2 days ago, but I can tell that _Fire_ is a one
in a million story. It has everything you could want in a space opera, with
a bunch of likeable, and unlikeable, characters. Reading this book is respecting
this man's life and legacy. I implore people to check this one out!


# Th-th-th That's all folks!
And that's the wrapup. I wanted to write on this blog more often, but it's just so
easy to make things, it's a lot harder to write up a whole post about them.
I'm working on a lot of complex things though, and these blog posts _are_ the best way I can
preserve technical information about those things. Maybe I'm still just trying to
catch my stride. Whatever the case, I'm not sweating it too much. Thanks for reading,
see ya next time!
